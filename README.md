# MSSN

This project produces an aquatic ecosystem with four different types of Pokemon living together.
They interact with the map by eating (gaining life) or getting damage in the fractal corals (losing a life). The map regenerates plankton(food).

You can interact with them by clicking and controlling one of them or utilizing the menu to spawn and control their comportments.
